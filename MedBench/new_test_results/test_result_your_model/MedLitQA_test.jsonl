Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.\nResults: We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.\nConclusions: Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

While this approach is supported by evidence from a recent non-randomized case series, earlier evidence suggested that there was no difference in risk for neonatal respiratory distress between pregnancies where the antidepressant was and was not discontinued 14 days prior to delivery after accounting for maternal illness severity. While CANMAT acknowledges this is a developing area, the benefits of tapering to reduce the risk of PNAS likely do not outweigh the risk of worsening maternal illness severity; hence reducing or discontinuing antidepressants near delivery is not recommended (Level 4).\n\n问题：指南指出，在围产期使用抗抑郁药可能会增加新生儿不良适应综合征（PNAS）的风险。对此，指南是否推荐在临近分娩时减少或停用抗抑郁药？为什么\n\n", "answer": null, "other": {"id": 106, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}
