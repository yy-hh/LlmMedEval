Patients with ACLF-3 more frequently require prolonged intubation and renal replacement therapy in the post-transplant period.\n\n问题：肝移植是治疗重症慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）的关键手段。请根据指南阐述，对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植对其生存率有何影响？同时，指南为何强调即使移植成功，这类患者的术后管理仍面临巨大挑战，并需要消耗大量医疗资源？\n\n", "answer": "答：根据提供的英文文献，对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植对其生存率的影响及术后管理挑战阐述如下：\n\n1. **肝移植对生存率的影响**：  \n   一项欧洲前瞻性观察研究（p 480）表明，与不进行肝移植相比，ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者接受肝移植后生存率显著提高。具体数据为：28天生存率分别为95% vs 23%，90天生存率分别为90.5% vs 12.5%。文献指出，肝移植与重症ACLF患者的生存获益相关（LoE 2，强共识），但患者适用性界限未知，需谨慎评估。\n\n2. **术后管理挑战和资源消耗的原因**：  \n   指南强调，即使移植成功，这类患者的术后管理仍面临巨大挑战，并需消耗大量医疗资源，原因包括：  \n   - **并发症高发**：在Artru等人的研究中，尽管1年移植后生存率达84%，但所有患者均出现并发症，其中81%发生术后获得性细菌感染、35%病毒性感染、15%真菌感染。  \n   - **ACLF-3级患者额外挑战**：ACLF-3级患者更常需要术后长期插管和肾脏替代治疗，增加管理难度。  \n   - **资源利用显著增加**：肝移植导致重症ACLF患者资源利用大幅上升（LoE 3，强共识），包括医疗设备、人力和后续治疗成本。  \n   这些挑战源于患者基础病情严重（如ACLF-3级更易出现多器官功能障碍），且移植后免疫抑制状态易引发感染和并发症，需多学科团队支持，但文献未提供具体指南细节，仅基于研究共识。", "other": {"id": 147, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}

Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.\nResults: We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.\nConclusions: Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.
