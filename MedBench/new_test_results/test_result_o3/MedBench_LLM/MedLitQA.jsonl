Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.\nResults: We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.\nConclusions: Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

Consequently, they do not consider bacterial infection, gastrointestinal bleeding or surgery as potential precipitating events for the development of ACLF.\"\n\n问题：本指南讨论了多种慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）的诊断标准。请比较欧洲肝病学会（EASL-CLIF-C）标准与亚太肝病学会（APASL）标准，并阐述两者在诱发因素、诊断核心以及所涵盖的患者人群方面有何核心区别？\n\n", "answer": "【答案】\n\n一、诱发因素（precipitants）的差异  \n1. EASL-CLIF-C：认为 ACLF 可由“肝内或肝外的急性应激事件”触发，因此既包括肝内刺激（如病毒复燃、酒精性肝炎、药物性肝损伤），也包括典型的肝外事件（如细菌感染、严重出血、手术、休克等）。  \n2. APASL：仅限“急性肝内损伤”触发，即主要是直接作用于肝脏的事件（如 HBV/HCV 再激活、急性病毒性肝炎、酒精或药物毒性、缺血性肝损伤等）。明确将细菌感染、胃肠道出血、外科手术等肝外事件排除在诱因之外。\n\n二、诊断核心（diagnostic focus）的差异  \n1. EASL-CLIF-C：以“器官衰竭”为核心。通过 CLIF-SOFA 等评分系统，若 6 大器官系统（肝、肾、脑、凝血、循环、呼吸）中≥1 个出现功能衰竭即可满足 ACLF 诊断。并不强制要求特定胆红素或 INR 阈值。  \n2. APASL：以“急性肝功能衰竭表现”——高胆红素和凝血障碍——为核心。具体标准为血清总胆红素 ≥5 mg/dL，INR ≥1.5，并在 4 周内出现腹水和/或肝性脑病。器官衰竭可出现但不是诊断前提。\n\n三、患者人群（target population）的差异  \n1. EASL-CLIF-C：对象为“已有肝硬化并出现急性失代偿（AD）的患者”，不论其既往是否发生过失代偿。无肝硬化者不在此定义范围内。  \n2. APASL：涵盖范围更宽，可包括  \n   ① 既往无失代偿史的肝硬化患者；  \n   ② 甚至包括非肝硬化但存在慢性肝病（CLD）的患者。  \n   因此 APASL 允许“非肝硬化的慢性肝病”患者被诊断为 ACLF，而 EASL-CLIF-C 则仅限于肝硬化人群。\n\n总结：  \nEASL-CLIF-C 将 ACLF视为“急性失代偿肝硬化伴一器官以上衰竭”，强调多器官衰竭概念，诱因涵盖肝内外事件，仅适用于肝硬化人群；APASL 则把 “急性肝功能失代偿（高胆红素＋凝血障碍）” 作为核心，可波及非肝硬化慢性肝病者，仅承认肝内急性诱因，不包括典型的肝外诱因。", "other": {"id": 143, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}

All have found that HBA-MRI is associated with higher sensitivity than ECA-MRI, particularly in small HCC. On the other hand, several head-to-head studies consistently showed the superiority of ECA-MRI over HBA-MRI for diagnosing HCC... In a multicentric prospective study...
