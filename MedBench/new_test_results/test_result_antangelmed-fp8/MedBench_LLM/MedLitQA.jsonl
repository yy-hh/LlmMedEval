Patients with ACLF-3 more frequently require prolonged intubation and renal replacement therapy in the post-transplant period.\n\n问题：肝移植是治疗重症慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）的关键手段。请根据指南阐述，对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植对其生存率有何影响？同时，指南为何强调即使移植成功，这类患者的术后管理仍面临巨大挑战，并需要消耗大量医疗资源？\n\n", "answer": "根据提供的英文文献，肝移植对于治疗重症慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）中的ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者具有明确的生存益处，但同时也带来显著的术后管理挑战和资源消耗问题。以下是具体阐述：\n\n### 1. 对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植对其生存率的影响\n文献指出，肝移植在ACLF-2或-3级患者中能显著提高生存率。一项前瞻性欧洲观察性研究显示，与不进行移植相比，肝移植可使患者的短期生存率大幅改善：例如，在术后28天时，移植组的生存率高达95%，而未移植组仅为23%；在90天时，移植组为90.5%，而未移植组仅为12.5%。这表明肝移植是ACLF-2和ACLF-3级患者的关键治疗手段，能有效逆转高死亡率。然而，文献也强调，患者适用性的具体限制尚不明确（LoE 2，强共识），因此需个体化评估。\n\n### 2. 为何即使移植成功，术后管理仍面临巨大挑战并需要大量医疗资源\n尽管肝移植能带来生存获益，但指南特别强调术后管理面临严峻挑战，主要原因包括：\n- **高并发症发生率**：文献提到，在Artru等人的研究中，即使1年生存率达84%，所有移植患者均出现并发症，其中81%发生术后获得性细菌感染、35%有病毒感染、15%有真菌感染。这些感染风险在ACLF-3级患者中更高，因为他们更常需要延长机械通气和肾替代治疗（如透析），这增加了医疗负担。\n- **资源消耗显著增加**：指南明确指出，肝移植与重症ACLF患者医疗资源使用的大幅增加相关（LoE 3，强共识）。例如，ACLF-3级患者术后更频繁地依赖重症监护支持，如长时间插管和肾脏替代治疗，这些措施不仅延长住院时间，还消耗大量人力、物力和设备资源。\n- **综合因素**：术后恢复期需要严密监测和积极处理各种并发症，这要求多学科团队协作，进一步推高成本。因此，尽管肝移植是“关键手段”，但其成功实施后仍需投入巨大资源来管理风险，确保患者安全。\n\n总之，文献支持肝移植作为ACLF-2和-3级患者的有效选择以改善生存，但必须权衡其带来的高资源需求和复杂术后护理挑战，临床决策应基于患者具体情况和可用资源。", "other": {"id": 147, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}

Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.\nResults: We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.\nConclusions: Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

All have found that HBA-MRI is associated with higher sensitivity than ECA-MRI, particularly in small HCC. On the other hand, several head-to-head studies consistently showed the superiority of ECA-MRI over HBA-MRI for diagnosing HCC... In a multicentric prospective study... The sensitivities of both MRI techniques were similar, but specificity was 83.3%... for ECA-MRI and 68.1%... for HBA-MRI... Another prospective study included 125 patients...
