Patients with ACLF-3 more frequently require prolonged intubation and renal replacement therapy in the post-transplant period.\n\n问题：肝移植是治疗重症慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）的关键手段。请根据指南阐述，对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植对其生存率有何影响？同时，指南为何强调即使移植成功，这类患者的术后管理仍面临巨大挑战，并需要消耗大量医疗资源？\n\n", "answer": "肝移植显著提高重症慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）患者的生存率。根据前瞻性欧洲观察性研究，对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植后28天生存率高达95%，而未移植组仅为23%；90天生存率分别为90.5%和12.5%。这表明肝移植能大幅改善短期预后。\n\n然而，指南强调即使移植成功，术后管理仍面临巨大挑战。原因在于：所有移植患者均出现并发症，其中81%发生细菌感染，35%病毒性感染，15%真菌感染；此外，ACLF-3级患者更频繁需要延长插管和肾脏替代治疗。这些并发症和额外支持治疗导致医疗资源消耗显著增加，如Artru等人的研究所示，尽管1年生存率达84%，但高感染率和器官支持需求使术后管理复杂化。因此，肝移植虽有效，但需充分考虑术后资源投入和并发症管理。", "other": {"id": 147, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}

Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.\nResults: We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.\nConclusions: Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

All have found that HBA-MRI is associated with higher sensitivity than ECA-MRI, particularly in small HCC. On the other hand, several head-to-head studies consistently showed the superiority of ECA-MRI over HBA-MRI for diagnosing HCC... In a multicentric prospective study... The sensitivities of both MRI techniques were similar, but specificity was 83.3%... for ECA-MRI and 68.1%... for HBA-MRI... Another prospective study included 125 patients... ECA-MRI detected HCC with 83.1% sensitivity and 86.6% accuracy, compared to... 71.2% sensitivity (p = 0.005) and 76.5% accuracy for HBA-MRI (p = 0.005).\n\n问题：针对HCC的非侵入性MRI诊断，指南讨论了两种不同的含钆对比剂：细胞外对比剂（ECA）和肝细胞特异性对比剂（HBA，如钆塞酸）。请问指南最终推荐优先选择哪一类对比剂？并从诊断的敏感性和特异性两个角度，阐述支持该推荐的核心理由。\n\n", "answer": "指南最终推荐优先选择细胞外对比剂（ECA）用于肝细胞癌（HCC）的非侵入性MRI诊断。这一推荐基于诊断敏感性和特异性的综合评估：在特异性方面，ECA-MRI（如多中心研究显示特异性为83.3%）显著优于肝细胞特异性对比剂（HBA-MRI，特异性为68.1%），能更有效地减少假阳性结果，避免误诊；在敏感性方面，尽管部分荟萃分析提示HBA-MRI对小HCC可能更敏感，但头对头研究（如125例患者的前瞻性研究）证实ECA-MRI的敏感性（83.1%）显著高于HBA-MRI（71.2%），且差异具有统计学意义（p=0.005），表明ECA在检测HCC方面更可靠。因此，ECA在整体诊断准确性上更具优势，符合临床实践需求。", "other": {"id": 149, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}
