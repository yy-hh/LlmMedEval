Patients with ACLF-3 more frequently require prolonged intubation and renal replacement therapy in the post-transplant period.\n\n问题：肝移植是治疗重症慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）的关键手段。请根据指南阐述，对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植对其生存率有何影响？同时，指南为何强调即使移植成功，这类患者的术后管理仍面临巨大挑战，并需要消耗大量医疗资源？\n\n", "answer": "对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，指南指出肝移植能显著提高生存率。根据一项前瞻性欧洲观察性研究，与未移植相比，接受尸肝移植的ACLF-2或ACLF-3患者生存率出现“显著/剧烈”改善：  \n- 28天生存率：移植组95%，未移植组23%；  \n- 90天生存率：移植组90.5%，未移植组12.5%。  \n因此，肝移植与明确的生存获益相关（强共识），尤其在重症ACLF人群中差异非常明显。\n\n但指南同时强调，即使移植成功，术后管理仍面临巨大挑战、并显著增加医疗资源消耗，原因主要包括：  \n1) 术后并发症负担极高：Artru等研究显示，尽管移植后1年生存率可达84%，但“所有”移植患者都出现了并发症。  \n2) 感染发生率非常高：81%发生移植后获得性细菌感染，35%发生病毒感染，15%发生真菌感染，提示需要密集监测、广谱/靶向抗感染治疗及隔离与支持治疗等。  \n3) 器官支持需求更大（尤其ACLF-3）：ACLF-3患者更常需要术后长时间插管（延长机械通气/ICU治疗）以及肾脏替代治疗（透析），这些都直接导致ICU住院时间延长、治疗复杂度上升和资源使用显著增加。\n\n综上，指南一方面肯定肝移植可大幅提升ACLF-2/3患者短期生存；另一方面也强调这类患者术后并发症与感染风险极高、常需多器官支持治疗，因此即便移植成功，仍是高强度管理、高资源消耗的临床情境。", "other": {"id": 147, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}

Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.\nResults: We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.\nConclusions: Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

All have found that HBA-MRI is associated with higher sensitivity than ECA-MRI, particularly in small HCC. On the other hand, several head-to-head studies consistently showed the superiority of ECA-MRI over HBA-MRI for diagnosing HCC... In a multicentric prospective study... The sensitivities of both MRI techniques were similar, but specificity was 83.3%... for ECA-MRI and 68.1%... for HBA-MRI... Another prospective study included 125 patients... ECA-MRI detected HCC with 83.1% sensitivity and 86.6% accuracy, compared to... 71.2% sensitivity (p = 0.005) and 76.5% accuracy for HBA-MRI (p = 0.005).\n\n问题：针对HCC的非侵入性MRI诊断，指南讨论了两种不同的含钆对比剂：细胞外对比剂（ECA）和肝细胞特异性对比剂（HBA，如钆塞酸）。请问指南最终推荐优先选择哪一类对比剂？并从诊断的敏感性和特异性两个角度，阐述支持该推荐的核心理由。\n\n", "answer": "指南最终推荐：在使用MRI进行HCC的非侵入性诊断时，应优先选择细胞外对比剂（ECA），而不是肝细胞特异性对比剂（HBA，如钆塞酸）（强推荐，证据等级LoE 1）。\n\n支持该推荐的核心理由（从敏感性与特异性两方面）：\n\n1）敏感性（Sensitivity）\n- 文献汇总显示：多项荟萃分析发现HBA-MRI的敏感性往往高于ECA-MRI，尤其是在小HCC的检出上更敏感。\n- 但指南强调：在“直接对照（head-to-head）研究”中，结果却一致显示ECA-MRI在HCC诊断上优于HBA-MRI；并且在部分前瞻性研究中，ECA-MRI的敏感性并不低，甚至更高（例如一项前瞻性研究中ECA-MRI敏感性83.1%，HBA-MRI为71.2%，差异有统计学意义）。\n\n2）特异性（Specificity）\n- 指南给出的关键点是：ECA-MRI的特异性更高、更稳定。\n- 例如多中心前瞻性研究中，两种MRI技术敏感性相近，但ECA-MRI特异性为83.3%，而HBA-MRI仅为68.1%。这意味着ECA-MRI更不容易把非HCC误判为HCC（假阳性更少），从而更利于“非侵入性诊断”所要求的可靠确诊。", "other": {"id": 149, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}
