Patients with ACLF-3 more frequently require prolonged intubation and renal replacement therapy in the post-transplant period.\n\n问题：肝移植是治疗重症慢加急性肝衰竭（ACLF）的关键手段。请根据指南阐述，对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，肝移植对其生存率有何影响？同时，指南为何强调即使移植成功，这类患者的术后管理仍面临巨大挑战，并需要消耗大量医疗资源？\n\n", "answer": "对于ACLF-2级和ACLF-3级患者，指南指出肝移植能带来明确且显著的生存获益。根据一项前瞻性欧洲观察性研究，与未移植相比，接受尸肝移植的ACLF-2或ACLF-3患者生存率在短期内大幅提高：28天生存率约为95%（未移植约23%），90天生存率约为90.5%（未移植约12.5%）。因此，肝移植在重症ACLF人群中与“显著改善生存”直接相关。\n\n但指南同时强调，即使移植成功，这类患者术后管理仍极具挑战、并显著增加医疗资源消耗，原因在于术后并发症和感染负担非常高。文献提到在Artru等研究中，尽管移植后1年生存率可达84%，但所有移植患者都出现并发症；且术后获得性感染发生率很高：细菌感染约81%，病毒感染约35%，真菌感染约15%。此外，ACLF-3患者在术后更常需要延长气管插管/机械通气支持，并更频繁需要肾脏替代治疗（如透析）。这些都意味着需要更长的ICU与住院时间、更密集的监护与抗感染治疗、更多器官支持，从而导致“资源利用显著增加”。", "other": {"id": 147, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}

Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.\nResults: We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.\nConclusions: Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

All have found that HBA-MRI is associated with higher sensitivity than ECA-MRI, particularly in small HCC. On the other hand, several head-to-head studies consistently showed the superiority of ECA-MRI over HBA-MRI for diagnosing HCC... In a multicentric prospective study... The sensitivities of both MRI techniques were similar, but specificity was 83.3%... for ECA-MRI and 68.1%... for HBA-MRI... Another prospective study included 125 patients... ECA-MRI detected HCC with 83.1% sensitivity and 86.6% accuracy, compared to... 71.2% sensitivity (p = 0.005) and 76.5% accuracy for HBA-MRI (p = 0.005).\n\n问题：针对HCC的非侵入性MRI诊断，指南讨论了两种不同的含钆对比剂：细胞外对比剂（ECA）和肝细胞特异性对比剂（HBA，如钆塞酸）。请问指南最终推荐优先选择哪一类对比剂？并从诊断的敏感性和特异性两个角度，阐述支持该推荐的核心理由。\n\n", "answer": "指南最终推荐：在使用MRI进行HCC（肝细胞癌）的非侵入性诊断时，应优先选择细胞外对比剂（ECA），而不是肝细胞特异性对比剂（HBA，如钆塞酸）。\n\n支持该推荐的核心理由（从敏感性与特异性两方面）：\n\n1）敏感性（sensitivity）\n- 文献汇总显示：多项荟萃分析认为HBA-MRI的敏感性往往高于ECA-MRI，尤其是在小HCC的检出上更敏感。\n- 但指南强调：在“直接对比（head-to-head）研究”中，结果却一致显示ECA-MRI在HCC诊断上优于HBA-MRI；并且在前瞻性研究中，ECA-MRI的敏感性并不差，甚至更高（例如一项前瞻性研究中ECA-MRI敏感性83.1%，HBA-MRI为71.2%，差异有统计学意义）。\n\n2）特异性（specificity）\n- 这是指南更关键的取舍点：前瞻性多中心研究显示，两者敏感性相近时，ECA-MRI的特异性明显更高（ECA-MRI 83.3% vs HBA-MRI 68.1%）。\n- 更高的特异性意味着更少的假阳性，更利于“非侵入性诊断”场景下对HCC作出更可靠的定性判断，因此指南据此给出“强推荐”优先使用ECA。", "other": {"id": 149, "source": "MedLitQA_V4"}, "options": null}
